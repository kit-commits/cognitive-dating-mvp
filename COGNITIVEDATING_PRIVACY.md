# Privacy Policy — Cognitive Dating MVP

## 1. Core Principles
- We collect only the data necessary to connect users safely and meaningfully.  
- Users have full control over what is shared and can revoke consent at any time.  
- No data is sold, shared with advertisers, or used for secondary purposes.  
- Our app is designed for ethical signal-based matching, not behavioral manipulation or gamification.

---

## 2. Data Collected
- Profile information (name, age, preferences) — user-provided.  
- Interaction signals (e.g., matches, likes) — used solely for matching.  
- Optional survey or personality data — only if the user opts in.

**What we do NOT collect:**  
- Geolocation unless explicitly enabled  
- Messages outside of the app  
- Payment data without explicit consent

---

## 3. User Control
- Users can edit or delete profile information at any time.  
- Users can withdraw consent for analytics or optional surveys.  
- Complete account deletion erases all personal data from our servers.

---

## 4. Security Measures
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.  
- Firebase rules ensure minimal access permissions.  
- Authentication uses standard secure practices (e.g., OAuth, email verification).

---

## 5. Third-Party Services
- Only essential third-party services (Firebase, analytics if opted-in) are used.  
- No ads, no reselling of user data.

---

## 6. Transparency
- All algorithms are signal-based and transparent; no opaque ranking mechanisms.  
- Gamification and engagement loops are intentionally avoided.
